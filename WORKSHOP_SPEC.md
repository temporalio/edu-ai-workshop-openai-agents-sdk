# Temporal + OpenAI Agents SDK – 90-min Codespaces Workshop Repo Spec

**The Master Blueprint**

*Everything you need to know about this workshop's architecture*

---

## Goal (Outcome, not Tasks)

<div align="center">

**Mission Statement**

</div>

Create a GitHub Codespaces-ready repository that teaches beginner→intermediate Python devs how to build **durable AI agents** using **OpenAI Agents SDK + Temporal** in **90 minutes**: 30 min instruction + 4×15 min hands-on exercises. Everything must run with **zero local setup**.

**Workshop Approach**: Students work through complete, working implementations in the `solutions/` directory during the workshop, learning by exploring and running production-quality code. After the workshop, the `exercises/` directory provides optional homework for students to practice building everything from scratch.

> **Success Criteria**: A complete beginner can go from "What's Temporal?" to "I built a production-ready AI agent!" in one session by following along with working code!

---

## Non-Goals

<div align="center">

**What This Workshop Is NOT**

</div>

- No secret keys in repo (security first)
- No complex frameworks; keep code short, didactic, and runnable <60s after Codespace boots
- No advanced agent orchestration beyond durability, retries, state, and tracing
- Not a deep dive into ML/AI theory (this is practical engineering)

> **Focus**: Hands-on, practical, production-ready patterns only!

## Architecture Patterns

<div align="center">

**The Learning Progression**

*From simple to sophisticated!*

</div>

The workshop teaches a progressive architecture pattern across exercises:

### **Exercise 1: Basic Agent Pattern**

```
       User Query
           ↓
   Agent (OpenAI LLM)
           ↓
     Tool Function
           ↓
     External API
           ↓
   Data returned to Agent
           ↓
   Agent uses LLM to generate response
           ↓
     Return to user
```

> **Learning Goal**: Understand how AI agents use tools

---

### **Exercise 2: Temporal Fundamentals**

```
   Workflow Request
           ↓
   Temporal Workflow
           ↓
   Temporal Activity
           ↓
        Result
```

> **Learning Goal**: Understand workflows, activities, and durability

---

### **Exercise 3: Durable Agent (Integration)**

```
       User Query
           ↓
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ Temporal Workflow         │  Orchestration
   │ (orchestration layer)     │
   └───────────────────────────┘
           ↓
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ Activity: Call LLM        │  AI Decision
   │    with tools             │
   └───────────────────────────┘
           ↓
      [If tool needed]
           ↓
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ Activity: Execute tool    │  Take Action
   └───────────────────────────┘
           ↓
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ Activity: Get final       │  Final Response
   │    LLM response           │
   └───────────────────────────┘
           ↓
       Return to user
```

**Key Insight:** Each activity can retry independently, and the entire flow is durable!

> **Learning Goal**: Combine AI agents with Temporal for production durability

- Exercises contain starter code with TODO markers for homework practice

---

## DevEx / Codespaces

- `devcontainer.json` installs Python 3.11 → calls `scripts/bootstrap.sh` post-create.
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh` installs deps, Temporal CLI, validates env (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- `scripts/run_temporal.sh` idempotent: if Temporal running, exit 0.
- Notebooks that host a Temporal worker **must** pass `workflow_runner=UnsandboxedWorkflowRunner()` and `debug_mode=True` to avoid sandbox validation errors inside Jupyter.
- **Makefile targets:**
  ```
  setup, env, lint, test, temporal-up, exercise-1, exercise-2, exercise-3
  ```

---

## Security & Keys

- `.env.sample` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=`; code reads only from env.
- `check_env.py` fails fast with helpful error if missing key.
- Pre-commit hook guidance to avoid committing secrets.

---

## CI (GitHub Actions)

- `ci.yml` runs on push/PR:
  - Python 3.11 → install deps → `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest -q`
- Tests mock OpenAI calls so CI passes without a real key.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Codespace cold-start → `make exercise-1` in ≤90s.
- `make exercise-1/2/3` succeed on fresh Codespace (API key required for #1/#3).
- Temporal UI link and `trace_id` printed clearly.
- Each file ≤80 lines, well-commented.
- README includes:
  - Codespaces badge
  - Agenda
  - Setup & troubleshooting
  - “Where to look” in Temporal UI & OpenAI Traces

---

## Docs to Generate

- Root `README.md` with launch, agenda, setup, troubleshooting.
- Each exercise `README.md` (as above).
- “Instructor Notes” section at bottom of root README with timing and pitfalls.

---

## Style & Teaching Rules

- Prioritize clarity over abstraction.
- Use linear, readable flow; verbose naming.
- Log start/end of activities, retries, and workflow resumptions.
- Comments explain _why_ (durability, retries, state).
- Activities exposed from notebooks should be declared with `async def` (or supplied with an explicit `activity_executor`) so the Temporal worker does not raise synchronous activity errors.

---

## Deliverables

- Full repo above, runnable in Codespaces with all exercises (solutions for workshop, exercises for homework), and CI passing.

---

## Iteration Prompts (For Claude)

**Tighten code & retries:**

> Refactor `solutions/03_durable_agent/solution.ipynb` to show explicit Temporal retry options and add logs before/after LLM calls. Ensure exercises/ has corresponding TODOs for students.

**Observability polish:**

> In `03_durable_agent/workflow.py`, print the Temporal UI URL and the `trace_id`. Add comments explaining state persistence and correlation with OpenAI Traces.

**Bootstrap resilience:**

> Make `scripts/run_temporal.sh` idempotent: if Temporal running, print “Temporal already running” and exit 0.

**Docs clarity:**

> Write `/solutions/03_durable_agent/README.md` and `/exercises/03_durable_agent/README.md`: Goal, Steps (≤5), Expected Output, Stretch Goal, Timebox (15 min). Include two screenshot placeholders.

**CI without real keys:**

> Add tests mocking OpenAI so `pytest -q` passes. Provide one test per exercise verifying expected return text.

5. Demo `solutions/04_agent_routing/` production structure with multiple agents.
6. Show traces in Temporal UI + OpenAI console.
7. Summarize durability, retries, and state.
8. Remind students: practice building from scratch using `exercises/` directory as homework.
9. Wrap up and Q&A.
