    "## Key Concepts: Temporal Durability\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Temporal?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal** is a workflow orchestration platform that provides durable execution for your applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automatic Retries:** Failed operations retry with exponential backoff\n",
    "- **State Persistence:** Workflow state survives crashes and restarts  \n",
    "- **Execution History:** Full audit trail visible in Temporal UI\n",
    "- **Replay-Safe:** Workflows can resume from any point after failure\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Agents + Temporal Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise combines **OpenAI Agents SDK** (from Exercise 1) with **Temporal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent defines behavior** - Same agent code from Exercise 1\n",
    "2. **Activity wraps execution** - Agent runs inside a Temporal activity\n",
    "3. **Temporal handles failures** - Automatic retries on network errors, API failures, etc.\n",
    "4. **No agent code changes** - Durability added by wrapping, not modifying!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `activity_as_tool()` Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The key integration point is `activity_as_tool()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tools=[\n",
    "    openai_agents.workflow.activity_as_tool(\n",
    "        get_weather,  # Your Temporal activity\n",
    "        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=10)\n",
    "    )\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts a Temporal activity into an Agent tool, giving you:\n",
    "- ✅ Automatic retries if the activity fails\n",
    "- ✅ State persistence across crashes\n",
    "- ✅ Full execution history in Temporal UI\n",
    "- ✅ Same agent interface as Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Without Temporal (Exercise 1):\n",
    "- ❌ Network failure = user sees error\n",
    "- ❌ Process crash = lost work  \n",
    "- ❌ API timeout = no retry\n",
    "- ❌ No audit trail\n",
    "\n",
    "With Temporal (Exercise 3):\n",
    "- ✅ Network failure = automatic retry\n",
    "- ✅ Process crash = resumes from checkpoint\n",
    "- ✅ API timeout = configurable retries\n",
    "- ✅ Full execution history in UI\n",
    "\n",
    "**The agent code is identical** - Temporal adds durability as a wrapper!"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You've implemented a durable weather agent using the **4-component pattern**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **activities.py** - Weather activity that fetches NWS alerts\n",
    "2. ✅ **workflow.py** - Workflow orchestrating the agent\n",
    "3. ✅ **worker.py** - Worker running in background\n",
    "4. ✅ **starter.py** - Workflow execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent tool calls are durable** - Temporal automatically retries failed activities\n",
    "- **Clean separation of concerns** - Each component has a specific responsibility\n",
    "- **Production-ready pattern** - This structure scales to real applications\n",
    "- **No agent code changes** - Durability added by wrapping, not modifying!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ How to wrap agents in Temporal activities for durability\n",
    "- ✅ How automatic retries work without changing agent code\n",
    "- ✅ How to structure production Temporal applications (4-component pattern)\n",
    "- ✅ How to test durability by simulating network failures\n",
    "- ✅ How to observe execution history in Temporal UI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continue your learning journey:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Exercise 4: Agent Routing](../04_agent_routing/)** - Build multi-agent systems with intelligent routing patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Want to dive deeper?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check the [solution notebook](../../solutions/03_durable_agent/solution.ipynb) for the complete implementation\n",
    "- Explore the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8233 to see execution history\n",
    "- Try the durability test: disconnect network during execution and watch automatic recovery!"

    "### Testing Durability (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "If you disconnect your network **while the workflow is executing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Activity fails** - You'll see an error in the worker logs\n",
    "2. **Temporal retries** - Automatically tries again after a delay\n",
    "3. **Reconnect network** - The next retry succeeds\n",
    "4. **Workflow completes** - You get the result as if nothing happened!\n",

    "**Check the Temporal UI** to see:\n",
    "- Retry attempts in the activity history\n",
    "- Timeline showing when retries occurred\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error: `Failed to connect to Temporal server`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Ensure Temporal is running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make temporal-up\n",
    "# Or: temporal server start-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check server at: http://localhost:8233\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error: `OPENAI_API_KEY is not set`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Add key to `.env` file in project root:\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then reload: `load_dotenv()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worker not picking up workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible causes:**\n",
    "- Worker isn't running (check cell output for \"Worker started\")\n",
    "- Task queue mismatch (ensure `TASK_QUEUE` matches in workflow and worker)\n",
    "- Worker crashed (check for error messages in worker cell)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Re-run the worker cell to restart it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network disconnect doesn't cause retry\n",
    "\n",
    "**For durability testing:**\n",
    "- Disconnect network **during** the API call, not before workflow starts\n",
    "- Watch Temporal UI for retry attempts\n",
    "- Look for activity errors in the Timeline view\n",
    "\n",
    "### No active alerts returned\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is normal!** Many states have no alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To test:**\n",
    "- Try different states: CA, TX, FL\n",
    "- Check [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov) for states with active alerts\n",
    "- Winter months typically have more alerts"
