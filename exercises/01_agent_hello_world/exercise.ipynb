    "> **💡 Tip:** If you get stuck, check the solution notebook in the `solutions/` directory! Each exercise has a corresponding complete solution that you can reference.\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenAI API Key:** Add your key to `.env` in the project root:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dependencies:** Already installed if you ran `make setup`\n",
    "   - `openai-agents` - OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "   - `httpx` - Async HTTP client\n",
    "   - `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management\n",

    "## Key Concepts: OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a modern framework for building agentic AI applications. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified agent creation** with the `Agent` class\n",
    "- **Automatic tool schema generation** with `@function_tool` decorator\n",
    "- **Built-in conversation management** via `Runner`\n",
    "- **Async/await support** for efficient I/O operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Pattern 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query 👤\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Agent (OpenAI LLM) 🤖\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[Does user need tool?]\n",
    "    ↓ Yes\n",
    "Tool Function: get_weather_alerts() 🔧\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "External API Call (NWS) 🌐\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Data returned to Agent 📊\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Agent generates response 💬\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Return to user ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow demonstrates how agents intelligently decide when to use tools to fulfill user requests!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool functions are Python functions that agents can call to perform actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decorated with `@function_tool` for automatic schema generation\n",
    "- Can call external APIs, databases, or any Python code\n",
    "- Return values are passed back to the LLM for final response generation\n",
    "- The LLM decides **when** and **how** to use tools based on user queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we use the **National Weather Service (NWS) API**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides free, real-time weather data for the United States\n",
    "- No API key required (but User-Agent header recommended)\n",
    "- Production-ready example of integrating external data sources\n",
    "- Demonstrates how agents can access live information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise teaches the **fundamental pattern** for all AI agents:\n",
    "1. Define tools (functions the agent can use)\n",
    "2. Create agent with instructions\n",
    "3. Run agent with user query\n",
    "4. Agent decides which tools to call\n",
    "5. Tools return data\n",
    "6. Agent generates final response\n",
    "\n",
    "This same pattern scales from simple weather queries to complex multi-step workflows!"
