    "# Exercise 1: Agent Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a simple AI agent with a custom weather tool using the OpenAI Agents SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timebox:** 15 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create an agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "- How to define custom tool functions with `@function_tool`\n",
    "- How to make real API calls (National Weather Service)\n",
    "- How to run the agent with asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "\n> **\ud83d\udca1 Tip:** If you get stuck, check the solution notebook in the `solutions/` directory! Each exercise has a corresponding complete solution that you can reference.\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenAI API Key:** Add your key to `.env` in the project root:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dependencies:** Already installed if you ran `make setup`\n",
    "   - `openai-agents` - OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "   - `httpx` - Async HTTP client\n",
    "   - `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internet Connection:** Required for real National Weather Service API calls"

    "## Key Concepts: OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a modern framework for building agentic AI applications. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified agent creation** with the `Agent` class\n",
    "- **Automatic tool schema generation** with `@function_tool` decorator\n",
    "- **Built-in conversation management** via `Runner`\n",
    "- **Async/await support** for efficient I/O operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Pattern \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query \ud83d\udc64\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "Agent (OpenAI LLM) \ud83e\udd16\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "[Does user need tool?]\n",
    "    \u2193 Yes\n",
    "Tool Function: get_weather_alerts() \ud83d\udd27\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "External API Call (NWS) \ud83c\udf10\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "Data returned to Agent \ud83d\udcca\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "Agent generates response \ud83d\udcac\n",
    "    \u2193\n",
    "Return to user \u2705\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow demonstrates how agents intelligently decide when to use tools to fulfill user requests!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool functions are Python functions that agents can call to perform actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decorated with `@function_tool` for automatic schema generation\n",
    "- Can call external APIs, databases, or any Python code\n",
    "- Return values are passed back to the LLM for final response generation\n",
    "- The LLM decides **when** and **how** to use tools based on user queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we use the **National Weather Service (NWS) API**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides free, real-time weather data for the United States\n",
    "- No API key required (but User-Agent header recommended)\n",
    "- Production-ready example of integrating external data sources\n",
    "- Demonstrates how agents can access live information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise teaches the **fundamental pattern** for all AI agents:\n",
    "1. Define tools (functions the agent can use)\n",
    "2. Create agent with instructions\n",
    "3. Run agent with user query\n",
    "4. Agent decides which tools to call\n",
    "5. Tools return data\n",
    "6. Agent generates final response\n",
    "\n",
    "This same pattern scales from simple weather queries to complex multi-step workflows!"

    "**Possible causes:**\n",
    "- Check your internet connection\n",
    "- NWS API may be temporarily unavailable (normal behavior)\n",
    "- Try a different state code\n",
    "- Verify the API endpoint URL is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "### No active alerts returned\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is normal!** Many states have no active weather alerts at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To test with active alerts:**\n",
    "- Try different states: CA, TX, FL, NY, etc.\n",
    "- Check [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov) to find states with current alerts\n",
    "- Winter months typically have more alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent not calling the tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible causes:**\n",
    "- Check that `tools=[get_weather_alerts]` is passed to `Agent()`\n",
    "- Verify the function is decorated with `@function_tool`\n",
    "- Ensure your query mentions weather or alerts for a US state"
