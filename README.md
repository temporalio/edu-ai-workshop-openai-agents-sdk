## 🔍 Key Concepts

<div align="center">

### 🧠 **The "Aha!" Moments** 🧠

*Understanding the magic behind durable agents*

</div>

### Why Temporal for AI Agents? 🤔

<table>
<tr>
<td width="200px">

**⚠️ The Problem**

</td>
<td>

AI agents in production face several challenges:

1. **💥 API Failures**: LLM APIs can be rate-limited or temporarily unavailable
2. **🔥 Crashes**: Your agent process might crash mid-execution
3. **⏳ Long-Running Ops**: Multi-step agent flows need to resume from checkpoints
4. **🔍 Observability**: You need to debug what your agent actually did

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**✨ The Solution**

</td>
<td>

Temporal solves these by providing:

- ✅ **Automatic retries** with configurable policies
- ✅ **State persistence** across failures and restarts
- ✅ **Execution history** for debugging and auditing
- ✅ **Durable execution** that survives crashes

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> 💡 **Think of Temporal as**: A time machine + a guardian angel for your code!

### Architecture Pattern 🏗️

```

   └───────────────────────────┘
           ↓
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │ Activity: Call LLM        │  🤖 AI Decision Making

**🌟 The Magic:** Each activity can retry independently, and the entire flow is durable! 💪

> 🎓 **Key Insight**: Your AI agent becomes unstoppable—it will complete its task even if the server crashes!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<div align="center">

### 🔧 **Common Issues & Quick Fixes** 🔧

*Don't panic—we've got you covered!*

</div>

---

### Environment Issues 🔐

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> not found</strong></summary>

```bash
# Check your .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Verify the key is set
python scripts/check_env.py
# Or run: make env
```

**✅ Fix:** If `.env` doesn't exist, create it from `.env.sample` (`cp .env.sample .env`), then add your API key 🔑

> 💡 **Tip**: Don't commit your `.env` file! It's in `.gitignore` for a reason.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Temporal server not running</strong></summary>

```bash
# Check if it's running
pgrep -f temporal
```

**✅ Fix:** Use the `temporal_installation.ipynb` notebook to install and start Temporal:
1. Open `temporal_installation.ipynb` in VS Code
2. Run each cell to install Temporal CLI and start the dev server
3. **Verify In Codespaces:** Go to the **Ports** tab → Find port **8233** → Click the **Globe icon** 🌐

⚠️ The Temporal dev server must be running for exercises 2, 3, and 4! ⚡

</details>

---

### Exercise Issues 📓

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Import errors when running exercises</strong></summary>

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
make setup
# Or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Run `make setup` whenever you pull new changes!

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Notebook kernel not found</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install ipykernel
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name temporal-workshop
```

Then select the `temporal-workshop` kernel in your notebook! 🎯

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Can't access Temporal UI at localhost:8233</strong></summary>

**In Codespaces:** The port should be automatically forwarded. To access it:
1. Go to the **Ports** tab at the bottom of VS Code
2. Find port **8233** 
3. Click the **Globe icon** 🌐 to open the Temporal Web UI in your browser
4. Make sure the port visibility is set to **Public** if you need to share it

**✅ Solution:** Make sure Temporal server is running using `temporal_installation.ipynb` and follow the Codespaces instructions above.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Tests fail with "module not found"</strong></summary>

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root and have installed in editable mode
cd /path/to/temporal-openai-agents-sdk
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Common Pitfalls ⚠️

<details>
<summary><strong>1️⃣ Students skip checking <code>.env</code></strong> 🔑</summary>

- Do environment check before starting (`make env`)
- Emphasize that exercises 1, 3, 4 need API key
- Have backup keys ready for those who forget

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2️⃣ Temporal not running</strong> ⚡</summary>

- Remind students to use `temporal_installation.ipynb` notebook to install and start Temporal
- Walk through opening the notebook and running each cell
- Show them how to verify In Codespaces: Go to the **Ports** tab → Find port **8233** → Click the **Globe icon** 🌐
- Verify EARLY before Exercise 2!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3️⃣ Confusion between workshop and homework</strong> 📓</summary>

- Clearly explain: work through `solutions/` during the workshop, practice building your own in `exercises/` afterward
- Solution notebooks are complete implementations to learn from during the workshop
- Exercises are for independent practice after the workshop (optional homework)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4️⃣ Temporal Activity timeouts</strong> ⏳</summary>

- Explain `start_to_close_timeout` defaults
- Show how to adjust for longer-running operations
- Common when students use GPT-4 vs GPT-4-mini

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5️⃣ Notebook vs Python files</strong> 📝</summary>

- Exercises 1-3 are Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) - work through `solutions/` during workshop
- Exercise 4 uses separate Python files (workflow.py, worker.py, starter.py)
- Emphasize Exercise 4 demonstrates production application structure
- After workshop, students can practice building their own using `exercises/` directory

</details>

### Key Teaching Points 🎯

<details>
<summary><strong>Exercise 1: Agent Foundations</strong> 🤖</summary>

- Walk through the complete solution notebook together
- Emphasize tool calling as the foundation of agentic behavior
- Show how the agent decides to use tools
- Highlight the real API integration (National Weather Service)
- **Demo tip**: Try queries that do and don't need tools

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exercise 2: Temporal Magic</strong> 🌊</summary>

- Walk through the solution notebook as a group
- Show the Temporal UI extensively - it's powerful for debugging! 🔍
- Walk through execution history
- Demonstrate the retry mechanism
- **Demo tip**: Kill the worker mid-execution and restart it!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exercise 3: THE KEY MOMENT</strong> 🌟</summary>

- Guide students through the solution notebook
- Show how activities make LLM calls durable
- The agent code doesn't change - Temporal wraps it!
- Emphasize: production-ready with zero agent modifications
- **Demo tip**: Show the Temporal UI and OpenAI trace correlation

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exercise 4: Production Patterns</strong> 🔀</summary>

- Walk through the production file structure together
- Language-based routing pattern (French/Spanish/English agents)
- Handoff pattern enables agent-to-agent transitions
- Demonstrates real Temporal application structure (separate worker/starter)
- Show how to run with two terminals (worker + starter)
- **Demo tip**: Show language detection in real-time
