    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Cell 2 shows an error immediately</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible causes:**\n",
    "1. Cell 1 didn't complete successfully - re-run Cell 1\n",
    "2. Temporal is already running - check if you have another instance running\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check if Temporal is already running:**\n",
    "Open a new terminal and run:\n",

    "pgrep -f \"temporal server\"\n",

    "<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Can't find the Ports tab in VS Code</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "1. Look at the bottom panel of VS Code\n",
    "2. You should see tabs: \"Terminal\", \"Problems\", \"Output\", \"Debug Console\", \"Ports\"\n",
    "3. If you don't see \"Ports\", you might not be in a Codespace\n",

    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><strong>❌ Problem: Port 8233 doesn't appear in Ports tab</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "1. Wait 10-15 seconds after starting the server\n",
    "2. Check that Cell 2 is still running (look for [*] on the left)\n",
    "3. Look at the output from Cell 2 - it should show \"UI: http://localhost:8233\"\n",
    "4. If still not visible, manually add it: Click \"+\" in Ports tab, enter \"8233\"\n",
